# WisconsinWarmind

This is a personal project that utilizes the Bungie.net API to obtain information about your Destiny 2 profiles.

# Setup

You will need to add a `config.js` file in the `src/js` directory that is modeled after the `sample_config.js` file that exists in that same directory.

Populate the `BUNGIE_API_KEY` constant with your API Key from Bungie. If you do not have an API Key yet, head to [https://www.bungie.net/en/Application](https://www.bungie.net/en/Application) to create an application and
obtain one.

# Run

Run the page using `npm run start` from the root directory
